# 6.835-project

## Prereqs for running: 
Windows, Leapmotion 3.2.1 SDK (https://developer.leapmotion.com/releases/leap-motion-orion-321), Python 2.7 64 bit

## To run:
Install the requirements in requirements.txt

Connect the leapmotion controller and place with the light facing towards you

Run main.py

## Tips
Sometimes the controller is finnicky, so it helps to have the diagnostic visualizer in the corner to see how things are working

The controller might also refuse to connect to the app, it helps to run as an administrator or to close and reopen the terminal
